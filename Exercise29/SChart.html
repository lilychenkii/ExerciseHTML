        <p>
            Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed.
